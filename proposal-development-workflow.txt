2016-05-21: Workflow for updating CleanThesis template with new additions, compiling Latex, and committing to Github
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

prerequisites:
	- install MacTex for Latex compilation: http://tug.org/mactex
	- install TeXShop for Mac OSX: http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html
		(note: may need to change some settings for OSX 10.11 El Capitan: http://tug.org/mactex/elcapitan.html)
	
1) open TeXShop application, and open up whichever *.tex files need to be edited
2) make changes, additions to *.tex files
3) typeset the .tex files by clicking the "Typeset" button in the upper left hand corner; be sure to select "LaTeX" for the format
4) TeXShop should automatically open up a PDF preview of the file that was created; inspect that the PDF is formatted properly
5) the typsetting process creates a bunch of garbage files; you can delete all of them that begin with the same name as the .tex file you were editing - delete the following:
	- *.aux
	- *.lof
	- *.lot
	- *.out
	- *.run.xml
	- *.synctex.gz
6) add any new files to git by "git add -f filename", and then commit with "git commit" and write a commit comment to denote what you added
7) push the changes up to Github with "git push -u origin master"
