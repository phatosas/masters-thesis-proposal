\chapter{Work Plan}
\label{sec:workplan}

%In this chapter, describe what your overall work plan is.  Be as specific as you can as to how the parts of your project work will come together so that you and your thesis director can make better decisions about changes as new information comes to light.

My plan for the development of this project will be to follow a loosely based "Scrum" development methodology, where I attempt to adhere to 2-week "sprints" wherein I successfully complete discrete functional parts of the project, and break out larger funtionality into small chunks that can be built and completed in the shorter sprint timeframe.  Before investing in much of the actual coding portion of the project, I will be developing wireframes that visually indicate the proposed "look and feel" of a prticular webpage.
