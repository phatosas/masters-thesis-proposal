I would like to ackowledge the excellent help, guidance, and wisdom of both Susan Buck and Dr. Jeff Parker.  They provided much needed tips and feedback over the course of the development of this thesis proposal which helped make it successful.

I want to also ackowledge and thank my wife Sarah and kids; thank you for being patient with me, putting up with my moods as I struggled through this process, and for all the tea.
